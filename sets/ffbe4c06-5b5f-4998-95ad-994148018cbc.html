            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Read the passage carefully. Then, answer all the questions that follow. Write your answers in full sentences and use information from the passage to support your answers.<br><br>Passage: The Evolution of the Internet<br><br></p>
<p>The Internet has transformed from a specialized communication network for scientists into a global system connecting billions of people. Its origins date back to the late 1960s, when the U.S. Department of Defense developed ARPANET to enable secure information sharing among researchers. Initially, the network connected only a few universities and government institutions. Over time, technological advancements led to broader accessibility and the birth of a revolutionary communication medium. What started as a small network for exchanging data soon became a foundation for global interaction, setting the stage for unprecedented connectivity.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, the development of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) standardized data exchange, allowing different networks to communicate. This innovation laid the foundation for the modern Internet. In the early 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web, a system of interlinked documents accessed through browsers. This made the Internet far more user-friendly, leading to rapid global expansion. Personal computers became more affordable, and educational institutions began integrating the Internet into research and learning, further accelerating its spread.</p>
<p>By the early 21st century, the Internet had become essential for business, education, entertainment, and social interaction. The rise of broadband and mobile technologies allowed people to access information anywhere and anytime. Social media platforms emerged, connecting individuals across continents and enabling the instant exchange of ideas, images, and news. Online shopping, video streaming, and digital communication transformed how societies function, making the Internet an indispensable part of daily routines.</p>
<p>Despite these benefits, the Internet also brought challenges. Issues such as cybersecurity threats, misinformation, and privacy concerns have become pressing. Governments and organizations continually work to create regulations and technologies that protect users while preserving the openness of the Internet. Today, emerging trends like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things continue to reshape the digital landscape. As these technologies develop, they influence economies, education systems, and even political processes.</p>
<p>The evolution of the Internet reflects both technological progress and societal change. What began as a research tool has become an integral part of daily life, influencing how people communicate, learn, and work worldwide.<br><br>How did the Internet change in the early 21st century?
