            <div class="answer">If I Were a Character in My Favourite anime series One-piece. I would been killed the higher authorities  who seeks enjoyment in killing people. After killing the higher authorities I would been freed the poor people who are in jail. The one who remains after killing the higher authorities I will play with them like they play with poor  people. I would be happy after seeing the poor people who has been freed. After I will become pirate like luffy the main character in one-piece and I will  become the king of the pirates. King of the pirates mean not ruling the sea its been like the most freest person in world.</div>

            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Read the passage carefully. Then, answer all the questions that follow. Write your answers in full sentences and use information from the passage to support your answers.<br><br>Passage: The Future of Renewable Energy The increasing demand for energy and the growing concerns over climate change have pushed nations to explore renewable energy sources more seriously than ever before. Renewable energy refers to power generated from resources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, these sources are sustainable and produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions, making them essential for a cleaner and more stable future. Solar energy has seen the fastest growth over the past decade. Improvements in photovoltaic (PV) technology have significantly lowered costs, allowing households and industries to install solar panels on rooftops or in large solar farms. Similarly, wind power has expanded rapidly, with both onshore and offshore wind farms supplying electricity to millions. Countries like Denmark and Germany have invested heavily in wind energy, often generating more power from wind than their total national demand on particularly windy days. Another emerging area is energy storage. Since solar and wind energy are intermittent, effective storage systems are crucial for ensuring a stable supply. Advances in battery technologies, such as lithium-ion and solid-state batteries, are making it possible to store surplus energy and use it during periods of low generation. Additionally, innovative grid management systems are helping integrate these renewable sources more efficiently into national power networks. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The initial investment for large-scale renewable infrastructure is high, which can be a barrier for developing countries. Furthermore, renewable energy projects often face regulatory hurdles and public opposition due to land use concerns. Addressing these issues requires coordinated policy frameworks, technological innovation, and public engagement to ensure a smooth transition to sustainable energy systems. The future of renewable energy is promising. With continued investment, supportive policies, and technological breakthroughs, renewable energy has the potential to become the dominant source of global power, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating the impacts of climate change.<br><br>Name two main sources of renewable energy mentioned in the passage.
