            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Write a well-organized paragraph of about 200 words on the topic “If I Were a Character in My Favourite Series/Movie.”</p></div>
            <div class="answer">If I were a character in My Favourite Series/Movie,I would be Thanos in the Avengers:Infinity Saga.A lot of people would consider him as the antagonist point of view,but for me its the other way around.He lost his home planet due to the devastation that has been created by the over population of the living beings,so Thanos thought clearing half of the living beings in each universe would be a right solution.since as a humans we often extract resources from our little earth and often harm it for our own desires.But we never think of the harm that we create to the earth such as pollution,etc.If I was Thanos,I would have used the infinty stones for a good future of both living beings and the planet,Instead of erasing half of the human race at once.The problem against which he stood was correct,but the methodology of solving the problem was wrong.I as Thanos would taken charge and would have created some advanced technology in a way to save the planets.In addition to that I would have joined Avengers for the cause of good deeds and stood against any harm for the people/Earth ,etc.So to conclude I would be a Thanos who would have done good contribution in saving planets if not mislead.</div>

            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Read the passage carefully. Then, answer all the questions that follow. Write your answers in full sentences and use information from the passage to support your answers.<br><br>Passage: The Future of Renewable Energy The increasing demand for energy and the growing concerns over climate change have pushed nations to explore renewable energy sources more seriously than ever before. Renewable energy refers to power generated from resources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, these sources are sustainable and produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions, making them essential for a cleaner and more stable future. Solar energy has seen the fastest growth over the past decade. Improvements in photovoltaic (PV) technology have significantly lowered costs, allowing households and industries to install solar panels on rooftops or in large solar farms. Similarly, wind power has expanded rapidly, with both onshore and offshore wind farms supplying electricity to millions. Countries like Denmark and Germany have invested heavily in wind energy, often generating more power from wind than their total national demand on particularly windy days. Another emerging area is energy storage. Since solar and wind energy are intermittent, effective storage systems are crucial for ensuring a stable supply. Advances in battery technologies, such as lithium-ion and solid-state batteries, are making it possible to store surplus energy and use it during periods of low generation. Additionally, innovative grid management systems are helping integrate these renewable sources more efficiently into national power networks. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The initial investment for large-scale renewable infrastructure is high, which can be a barrier for developing countries. Furthermore, renewable energy projects often face regulatory hurdles and public opposition due to land use concerns. Addressing these issues requires coordinated policy frameworks, technological innovation, and public engagement to ensure a smooth transition to sustainable energy systems. The future of renewable energy is promising. With continued investment, supportive policies, and technological breakthroughs, renewable energy has the potential to become the dominant source of global power, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating the impacts of climate change.<br><br>Name two main sources of renewable energy mentioned in the passage.

            <div class="answer">The day was bright and clear, butterflies enjoying the day.The New college felt like a new beginning and new life to a Shy student like Ramu. He was very nervous to look upon everyone so he went to the class in a shivering manner.Ramu is a trade-mark introvert who often avoids the stage  to give a speech in front of people.He escaped this trap every single time in during his school days, but this time he was caught red-handed.Ramu has to give his First introduction in front of his classmates.He shivered,trembled,but somehow managed to get an applause.But the destiny never leaves us. A group assignment was given by the instructor.So Ramu slipped into a 4 member group.Soon he slowly started interacting with others, they had a good time, helping each other ,having lunch together,etc.But one day ,a clash occured with his friend Somu due to a misunderstanding,then both had a honest talk which made a strong bond  and made his friendship ,a true friendship.This friendship removed his shyness for the rest of his life.</div>
