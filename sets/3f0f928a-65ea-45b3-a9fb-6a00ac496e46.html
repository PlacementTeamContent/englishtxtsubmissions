            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Write a well-organized paragraph of about 200 words on the topic “The Role of Sports in Education.” Use facts, examples, and logical explanations to support your ideas.</p></div>
            <div class="answer">Topic: role of sports in education

we all think that sports helps that to maintain physical fitsness, but inspect of this sports play a major role also to maintain our mental health which is important in education , when we play sports it  helps to avoid our lazy ness and to be active , second major thing is if we get interested in sports is helps us for avoiding mobile phone which was ,major distraction for students in there education,then sports like chess carroms and other board games and sports helps us to improve are thinking ability ,by playing this sports we can devolp our ideas and maintian our mental health.
In this generation studens are attracted by phones and there becaome lazy so by plaing sports they get easily avoid this using phone.
sports are also learn us like some qualities like sportsman ship, patients, honour to the team ment,collective working with others,
like this we can learn so many qualities from sports which can help not only in education but also in life</div>

            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Read the passage carefully. Then, answer all the questions that follow. Write your answers in full sentences and use information from the passage to support your answers.<br><br>Passage: The Future of Renewable Energy The increasing demand for energy and the growing concerns over climate change have pushed nations to explore renewable energy sources more seriously than ever before. Renewable energy refers to power generated from resources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, these sources are sustainable and produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions, making them essential for a cleaner and more stable future. Solar energy has seen the fastest growth over the past decade. Improvements in photovoltaic (PV) technology have significantly lowered costs, allowing households and industries to install solar panels on rooftops or in large solar farms. Similarly, wind power has expanded rapidly, with both onshore and offshore wind farms supplying electricity to millions. Countries like Denmark and Germany have invested heavily in wind energy, often generating more power from wind than their total national demand on particularly windy days. Another emerging area is energy storage. Since solar and wind energy are intermittent, effective storage systems are crucial for ensuring a stable supply. Advances in battery technologies, such as lithium-ion and solid-state batteries, are making it possible to store surplus energy and use it during periods of low generation. Additionally, innovative grid management systems are helping integrate these renewable sources more efficiently into national power networks. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The initial investment for large-scale renewable infrastructure is high, which can be a barrier for developing countries. Furthermore, renewable energy projects often face regulatory hurdles and public opposition due to land use concerns. Addressing these issues requires coordinated policy frameworks, technological innovation, and public engagement to ensure a smooth transition to sustainable energy systems. The future of renewable energy is promising. With continued investment, supportive policies, and technological breakthroughs, renewable energy has the potential to become the dominant source of global power, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating the impacts of climate change.<br><br>Name two main sources of renewable energy mentioned in the passage.
