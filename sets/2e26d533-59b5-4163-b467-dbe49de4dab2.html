            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Write a well-organized paragraph of about 200 words on the topic “The Role of Sports in Education.” Use facts, examples, and logical explanations to support your ideas.</p></div>
            <div class="answer">TOPIC:THE ROLE OF SPORTS IN EDUCATION

The role sports is very important in education as well as in our personal life also.There will be no joy in our life if there is no sports.Lets just imagine there is no sports in world ..The old generation people will suffer more because sports is part of their life ,.In todays generation (for some people) it is acceptable if there is no sports because we have phone,laptop,video game,etc.... to spen our time but just imagine of old generation people they don&#39;t have any of this not even telephone,so sports become their life ....
         That why tamilnadu government introduce this job stream where  tamilnadu government  gave job for tamil nadu  people who are in sports field even after they reteriment.</div>

            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Read the passage carefully. Then, answer all the questions that follow. Write your answers in full sentences and use information from the passage to support your answers.<br><br>Passage: The Future of Renewable Energy
The increasing demand for energy and the growing concerns over climate change have pushed nations to explore renewable energy sources more seriously than ever before. Renewable energy refers to power generated from resources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, these sources are sustainable and produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions, making them essential for a cleaner and more stable future.
Solar energy has seen the fastest growth over the past decade. Improvements in photovoltaic (PV) technology have significantly lowered costs, allowing households and industries to install solar panels on rooftops or in large solar farms. Similarly, wind power has expanded rapidly, with both onshore and offshore wind farms supplying electricity to millions. Countries like Denmark and Germany have invested heavily in wind energy, often generating more power from wind than their total national demand on particularly windy days.
Another emerging area is energy storage. Since solar and wind energy are intermittent, effective storage systems are crucial for ensuring a stable supply. Advances in battery technologies, such as lithium-ion and solid-state batteries, are making it possible to store surplus energy and use it during periods of low generation. Additionally, innovative grid management systems are helping integrate these renewable sources more efficiently into national power networks.
Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The initial investment for large-scale renewable infrastructure is high, which can be a barrier for developing countries. Furthermore, renewable energy projects often face regulatory hurdles and public opposition due to land use concerns. Addressing these issues requires coordinated policy frameworks, technological innovation, and public engagement to ensure a smooth transition to sustainable energy systems.The future of renewable energy is promising. With continued investment, supportive policies, and technological breakthroughs, renewable energy has the potential to become the dominant source of global power, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating the impacts of climate change.<br><br>Analyze two major challenges faced by renewable energy development and explain how they can be addressed. (2)</p></div>
            <div class="answer">1. ONE THE MAJOR CHALLANGE FACE BY RENEWABLE ENERGY IS: Renewable energy projects often face regular hurdles and public opposition due to land use concerns. Addressing these issues requires coordinated policy frameworks, technological innovation, and public engagement to ensure a smooth transition to sustainable energy systems 
2. And the second challange is the initial inversement for ,large-scale renewable infrastructure is high , which can be a barrier for developing countries like india ,america,etc...
3.The another challange faced by renewable energy like solar,wind is both are intermittent, effective storage systems are crucial for ensuring a stable supply. Advances in battery technologies,such as lithium -ions ans solid-state batteries, are making it possible to store surplus energy and use it during periods of low generation.additionally innovative grid management systems are helping intergrate these renewable sources to work more efficiently into national power networks .</div>

Rearrange them in a logical sequence to show how the process is completed effectively.<br><br>Jumbled Sentences: Next, form a small organizing committee and assign roles such as publicity, logistics, and registration. Finally, after the event, send thank-you notes to speakers and collect participant feedback for improvement. After that, prepare an agenda and coordinate with speakers about their topics and presentation time. First, decide on a relevant theme and objectives for the seminar based on student or departmental needs. Then, arrange the necessary equipment like microphones, projectors, and seating in the venue. Later, design posters and social media posts to publicize the event and invite attendees. Before the seminar day, rehearse the program flow to ensure everything runs smoothly.</p></div>
