The 20th century marked the beginning of humanity’s journey beyond Earth. Space exploration began during the Cold War, driven by competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, which orbited Earth and marked the dawn of the Space Age. This event inspired the United States to intensify its space program, leading to rapid advancements in technology and exploration.A major milestone occurred in 1961 when Yuri Gagarin became the first human to travel into space aboard Vostok 1. This achievement demonstrated that humans could survive and operate beyond Earth’s atmosphere. The competition reached its peak in 1969 when NASA’s Apollo 11 mission successfully landed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon. Armstrong’s famous words, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,” symbolized human ambition and scientific progress.After the Moon landings, space exploration evolved from rivalry to international cooperation. The establishment of the International Space Station (ISS) in the late 1990s brought together space agencies from the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan, and Canada. The ISS serves as a research laboratory where astronauts conduct experiments in biology, physics, and medicine in microgravity, leading to discoveries that benefit life on Earth.Today, space exploration is entering a new phase. Private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are playing key roles by developing reusable rockets and planning commercial missions. Countries such as China and India are expanding their space programs, aiming for lunar bases and Mars exploration. Future missions may focus on asteroid mining, deep-space travel, and the search for extraterrestrial life.Space exploration reflects humanity’s enduring curiosity and technological innovation. What began as a geopolitical competition has transformed into a shared global endeavor to understand the universe and our place in it.<br><br> Questions: Analyze two key phases in the history of space exploration and their significance.
