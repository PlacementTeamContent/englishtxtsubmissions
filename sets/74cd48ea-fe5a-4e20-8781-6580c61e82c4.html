The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century marked a turning point in European history. Before its invention, books were laboriously copied by hand, usually by monks in monasteries, making them expensive and rare. Knowledge was largely confined to religious institutions and the elite. Gutenberg’s press, using movable metal type, transformed the production of books by allowing texts to be replicated quickly and accurately. This technological breakthrough made written works more accessible to the public than ever before. It represented not only a change in how information was shared, but also a cultural shift toward broader participation in learning and intellectual life.One of the earliest major works printed was the Gutenberg Bible, completed around 1455. Its high quality demonstrated that printed books could rival handwritten manuscripts in beauty and clarity. Within a few decades, printing presses had spread across Europe to cities such as Venice, Paris, and London. This rapid expansion led to a dramatic increase in literacy rates, as books became more affordable for the middle classes. Universities and scholars gained access to a wider range of texts, accelerating the exchange of ideas. Libraries expanded their collections, and educated citizens began to engage more actively with literature, science, and philosophy.The printing press also played a crucial role in shaping the Renaissance, Reformation, and Scientific Revolution. During the Reformation, for example, Martin Luther’s ideas spread rapidly through printed pamphlets and translated Bibles, challenging the authority of the Catholic Church. Similarly, scientific works such as those by Copernicus and Galileo reached a broader audience, fostering debate and critical thinking. Philosophers, artists, and scientists alike benefited from the new ability to distribute their works widely and consistently.However, this new technology also brought challenges. Authorities attempted to control printed materials through censorship, fearing the spread of ideas that could undermine political or religious power. Despite these efforts, print culture flourished, creating a more informed and engaged public. Over time, the printing press laid the foundation for modern mass communication and education systems, reshaping European society in profound ways.<br><br>Question: Analyze two major impacts of the printing press on European society.

<p>The Internet has transformed from a specialized communication network for scientists into a global system connecting billions of people. Its origins date back to the late 1960s, when the U.S. Department of Defense developed ARPANET to enable secure information sharing among researchers. Initially, the network connected only a few universities and government institutions. Over time, technological advancements led to broader accessibility and the birth of a revolutionary communication medium.

<p>During the 1980s, the development of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) standardized data exchange, allowing different networks to communicate. This innovation laid the foundation for the modern Internet. In the early 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web, a system of interlinked documents accessed through browsers. This made the Internet far more user-friendly, leading to rapid global expansion. Personal computers became more affordable, and educational institutions began integrating the Internet into research and learning, further accelerating its spread.</p>
<p>By the early 21st century, the Internet had become essential for business, education, entertainment, and social interaction. The rise of broadband and mobile technologies allowed people to access information anywhere and anytime. Social media platforms emerged, connecting individuals across continents and enabling the instant exchange of ideas, images, and news. Online shopping, video streaming, and digital communication transformed how societies function, making the Internet an indispensable part of daily routines.</p>
<p>Despite these benefits, the Internet also brought challenges. Issues such as cybersecurity threats, misinformation, and privacy concerns have become pressing.
