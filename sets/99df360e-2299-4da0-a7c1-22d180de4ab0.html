            <div class="answer">If I was character in my favourite movie. My favourite movie is devara. If I was hero in the that I will stop the smuggled goods coming from the foreign countries and will search who is the main boss sending goods in the ships and I will create some people for searching them in the all foreign countries, I will also found my father where he went and what  is he doing  from so many and I will attack on the ship. I will collect all smuggled goods and I give training to the young people who are in the our village. I will build a college for people who are above 15 years. I will do so much help for my people in the village. I will change mindset of my people in the village do not do any bad things.

            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Read the passage carefully. Then, answer all the questions that follow. Write your answers in full sentences and use information from the passage to support your answers.<br><br>Passage: The Rise of Citizen Science</p>
<p>In recent decades, citizen science has emerged as a powerful approach to conducting research by involving members of the public in scientific investigations. Unlike traditional research that relies solely on trained scientists, citizen science leverages the collective efforts of volunteers to collect data, make observations, and even analyze results. This participatory method has expanded the scale and scope of research across fields such as ecology, astronomy, public health, and environmental monitoring.
One of the earliest large-scale citizen science projects was the Audubon Christmas Bird Count, which began in 1900. Participants across North America recorded bird sightings to help track bird populations over time. Today, technology has accelerated the growth of such initiatives. Smartphone apps, online databases, and social media platforms allow participants to upload information instantly, making data collection more efficient and widespread. For example, platforms like iNaturalist and Galaxy Zoo enable users worldwide to contribute observations and classifications that scientists can later verify and analyze.
Citizen science also fosters a deeper public understanding of scientific processes. By engaging in data collection or analysis, participants develop a sense of ownership over research and become more informed about environmental and societal challenges. This collaborative model not only produces valuable scientific data but also builds bridges between experts and communities, leading to more inclusive and democratic forms of knowledge creation.However, citizen science also faces challenges. Ensuring data accuracy remains a major concern, as participants may have varying levels of expertise. To address this, many projects provide training materials, verification systems, and expert oversight. Another challenge is sustaining participant engagement over time. Successful projects often build communities around shared goals, recognizing volunteers’ contributions and maintaining open communication.
Overall, citizen science represents a transformative shift in how knowledge is produced and shared. It blends technology, community involvement, and scientific inquiry to tackle complex issues on a global scale.<br><br>If a university wanted to track air quality across its city, explain how a citizen science approach could help achieve this goal.
