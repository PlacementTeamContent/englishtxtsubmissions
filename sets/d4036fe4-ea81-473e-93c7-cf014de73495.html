            <div class="answer">If I was a character in my favourite series , I would be Spider - man were I could swing around the city and save the people in my city. I can fight with the thugs the city and  make a new friend circle, And also i can wake upto 3AM morning. I will be the class topper, and i like to take the responsibility. So by any chance someone will fall in love with me to make my life happy after a rough day with villans I have face throught the day. So, i would love to be spider - man.</div>

<p>In recent decades, citizen science has emerged as a powerful approach to conducting research by involving members of the public in scientific investigations. Unlike traditional research that relies solely on trained scientists, citizen science leverages the collective efforts of volunteers to collect data, make observations, and even analyze results. This participatory method has expanded the scale and scope of research across fields such as ecology, astronomy, public health, and environmental monitoring.
One of the earliest large-scale citizen science projects was the Audubon Christmas Bird Count, which began in 1900. Participants across North America recorded bird sightings to help track bird populations over time. Today, technology has accelerated the growth of such initiatives. Smartphone apps, online databases, and social media platforms allow participants to upload information instantly, making data collection more efficient and widespread. For example, platforms like iNaturalist and Galaxy Zoo enable users worldwide to contribute observations and classifications that scientists can later verify and analyze.
Citizen science also fosters a deeper public understanding of scientific processes. By engaging in data collection or analysis, participants develop a sense of ownership over research and become more informed about environmental and societal challenges. This collaborative model not only produces valuable scientific data but also builds bridges between experts and communities, leading to more inclusive and democratic forms of knowledge creation.However, citizen science also faces challenges. Ensuring data accuracy remains a major concern, as participants may have varying levels of expertise. To address this, many projects provide training materials, verification systems, and expert oversight. Another challenge is sustaining participant engagement over time. Successful projects often build communities around shared goals, recognizing volunteers’ contributions and maintaining open communication.
Overall, citizen science represents a transformative shift in how knowledge is produced and shared. It blends technology, community involvement, and scientific inquiry to tackle complex issues on a global scale.<br><br>If a university wanted to track air quality across its city, explain how a citizen science approach could help achieve this goal.

            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Read the passage carefully. Then, answer all the questions that follow. Write your answers in full sentences and use information from the passage to support your answers.<br><br>Passage: The Future of Renewable Energy The increasing demand for energy and the growing concerns over climate change have pushed nations to explore renewable energy sources more seriously than ever before. Renewable energy refers to power generated from resources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, these sources are sustainable and produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions, making them essential for a cleaner and more stable future. Solar energy has seen the fastest growth over the past decade. Improvements in photovoltaic (PV) technology have significantly lowered costs, allowing households and industries to install solar panels on rooftops or in large solar farms. Similarly, wind power has expanded rapidly, with both onshore and offshore wind farms supplying electricity to millions. Countries like Denmark and Germany have invested heavily in wind energy, often generating more power from wind than their total national demand on particularly windy days. Another emerging area is energy storage. Since solar and wind energy are intermittent, effective storage systems are crucial for ensuring a stable supply. Advances in battery technologies, such as lithium-ion and solid-state batteries, are making it possible to store surplus energy and use it during periods of low generation. Additionally, innovative grid management systems are helping integrate these renewable sources more efficiently into national power networks. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The initial investment for large-scale renewable infrastructure is high, which can be a barrier for developing countries. Furthermore, renewable energy projects often face regulatory hurdles and public opposition due to land use concerns. Addressing these issues requires coordinated policy frameworks, technological innovation, and public engagement to ensure a smooth transition to sustainable energy systems. The future of renewable energy is promising. With continued investment, supportive policies, and technological breakthroughs, renewable energy has the potential to become the dominant source of global power, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating the impacts of climate change.<br><br>Name two main sources of renewable energy mentioned in the passage.
