Your story should include a clear beginning, middle, and ending, with well-developed characters, setting, and events.

            <div class="answer">The sun used it bright rays to poke my eyelids gently to woke me up through the window. I woke up late that day as it was a holiday. That day happened to be the day my mother gave birth to me. In short it was my birthday.  I brushed my teeth, washed my face and climbed down the stairs from my room to the main living room in my house. We as a South Indian family ate in the living room sitting down. The breakfast to my surprise was my favourite non-veg dish. My mother had made me a feast and I enjoyed it to the maximum. Once I finished eating I as usual on holidays started to idle around the house. But then I heard the sounds of people at the front door. Like a stray cat approached by a human I slowly went near the door knob to unlock it and found that there were some unexpected guests standing outside. The guests were no other than my friends from my educational institution and some of my relatives. I welcomed them in witha a gesture and they, with their hands holding a gift went inside. I got handwritten cards from my friends wishing me a very happy birthday and hoping that this day will repeat again. We then sang my favourite song and danced to it. We took a group photo in the memory of them being there to celebrate my birthday in this grand fashion. My ears started to water a little because I was so moved by the gesture they made for my birthday. I thanked everyone from the bottom of my heart. And then we enjoyed a party in the evening with soft drinks and junk food. The day was one of the best days of my life and it was simply unforgettable.</div>

<p>In the 21st century, the world has witnessed an unprecedented surge in digital connectivity. The internet, social media, and smartphones have revolutionized how humans communicate, learn, and form relationships. While this digital expansion has shrunk geographical distances and made information universally accessible, it has also introduced a paradoxical sense of isolation. Individuals are more “connected” than ever, yet many report heightened feelings of loneliness and disconnection.One of the main causes of this paradox lies in the quality of interactions. Online exchanges often lack the depth and empathy present in face-to-face communication. Digital conversations, limited by emojis and abbreviations, can fail to capture emotional nuances. As a result, people might have numerous virtual “friends” but few meaningful relationships. Moreover, the constant exposure to curated online lives can lead to social comparison, fostering insecurity and dissatisfaction.Another dimension of this paradox is the illusion of productivity. Technology promises efficiency, but constant notifications and multitasking often fragment attention. Studies show that individuals who frequently switch between digital tasks experience reduced concentration and memory retention. The “always-on” culture, driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO), has blurred boundaries between personal and professional life, contributing to mental exhaustion and stress.Yet, digital connectivity is not inherently detrimental. It has democratized education, enabled remote work, and amplified global awareness on issues like climate change and social justice. The key challenge lies in achieving balance—using technology mindfully without allowing it to dominate human experience. Digital literacy programs and conscious online habits can foster a healthier relationship with technology.Ultimately, digital connectivity represents both progress and peril. It mirrors human intention: the same tools that unite can also divide, depending on how they are used. The paradox, then, is not in technology itself but in humanity’s dependence on it.<br><br> Questions: How can individuals apply digital literacy to reduce the negative effects of technology? (2)</p></div>
            <div class="answer">By fostering conscious online habits one can foster a healthier relationship and acheive balance in the use of technology. The key challenge is to acheive balance and use technology mindfully which can be done via digital literacy.</div>

(2)</p></div>
            <div class="answer">Technology promises efficiency, but constatnt notifications fragment our attention. This is called the &#34;illusion of productivity&#34;. This creates an illusion that we have worked for a long period of time but in actualit our focus and attention might have got fragmented and the work we could have done in that period of time is much more than what we have done. This is how &#34;illusion of productivity&#34; contributes to the paradox of digital connectivity.</div>

The 20th century marked the beginning of humanity’s journey beyond Earth. Space exploration began during the Cold War, driven by competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, which orbited Earth and marked the dawn of the Space Age. This event inspired the United States to intensify its space program, leading to rapid advancements in technology and exploration.A major milestone occurred in 1961 when Yuri Gagarin became the first human to travel into space aboard Vostok 1. This achievement demonstrated that humans could survive and operate beyond Earth’s atmosphere. The competition reached its peak in 1969 when NASA’s Apollo 11 mission successfully landed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon. Armstrong’s famous words, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,” symbolized human ambition and scientific progress.After the Moon landings, space exploration evolved from rivalry to international cooperation. The establishment of the International Space Station (ISS) in the late 1990s brought together space agencies from the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan, and Canada. The ISS serves as a research laboratory where astronauts conduct experiments in biology, physics, and medicine in microgravity, leading to discoveries that benefit life on Earth.Today, space exploration is entering a new phase. Private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are playing key roles by developing reusable rockets and planning commercial missions. Countries such as China and India are expanding their space programs, aiming for lunar bases and Mars exploration. Future missions may focus on asteroid mining, deep-space travel, and the search for extraterrestrial life.Space exploration reflects humanity’s enduring curiosity and technological innovation. What began as a geopolitical competition has transformed into a shared global endeavor to understand the universe and our place in it.<br><br> Questions: Examine how private companies are influencing the future of space exploration.

            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Write a well-organized paragraph of about 200 words on the topic “The Influence of Social Media on Youth Culture.” Use facts, examples, and logical explanations to support your ideas.<br><br>Topic: The Influence of Social Media on Youth Culture • Introduction: The growing role of social media in shaping modern youth culture • Influence on fashion trends — how styles spread quickly through platforms (e.g., Instagram, TikTok) • Changes in lifestyle choices — interests, hobbies, entertainment, and consumer behavior shaped by what’s trending online • Identity building — how youth express themselves, create personal brands, or find communities through social media • Global exposure vs peer pressure — access to new ideas and cultures vs pressure to conform to online standards • Concluding sentence highlighting social media as a powerful but double-edged tool in shaping youth culture</p></div>
            <div class="answer">Social Media is a new but very powerful form of media that has come to overshadow the other forms of media. In the era of smartphones, social media is not only a tool for entertainment but is a tool of empowerment. Social media is the main benefactor of the cultural changes that have occured in the current generation. A decade back, fashion was decided by what the stars in the movies, songs wore. But now, fashion industry is hugely impacted by social media influencers as they are the ones who now set the standard for what is fashionable and what is not. Social media has exposed us to a lot of new things enabling us to experience and learn more things. It has bring to light many art forms and hobbies that many of us know nothing of and has also inspired people to pick up interests and hobbies due to the exposure. Consumer behaviour is shaped by advertisements. Right now the most impactful form of advertisement is done via social media marketing. People by getting exposure to many things have started to express their own ideas and opinions on the social media. This creates an internet identity. Through social media personal branding can also be done as the information we put in the social media is public to see and it&#39;s free to use. Since social media has provided so much exposure, many people has started to use it more frequently causing them to be hooked on the identity they have created in the internet. Since the opinions are easily shared in the social media it has become easy to pick on someone or destroy somebody&#39;s career simply by sharing what the person thinks. Even though social media has provided us a platform for raising our voices and is shaping the youth culture, we should be careful where we raise our voice since social media is a double-edged sword.</div>
