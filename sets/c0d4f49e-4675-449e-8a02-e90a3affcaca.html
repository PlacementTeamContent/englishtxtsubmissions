            <div class="answer">An Unexpected Journey.

One fine day, I woke with the same dream that I had multiple times since my childhood, that is, Climbing Mount Everest.
But that day I decided to turn the ever-lasting dream into reality, and planned a fully prepared trip to the Himalayas. I packed up my bags with all the equipment and other needed items and essentials, right from cloths to tooth brush everything was perfectly packed in a new backpack, and I left home for Central Railway Station and boarded my Train to Himalayas, That train travel was one of the most precious moments of my life where I got to experience the true connectivity with nature and those thin and chill fresh air glazed through all over my body from the window then the train moved through those risky tracks in the hilly areas along with that Beautiful scenario felt like heaven on Earth. But unfortunately, I slept and missed the stop. I was in total panic, but then those friendly local people who belong to that place showed their kind hospitality and helped me return home. It was a totally unforgettable experience of my lifetime, a memory that I will cherish all my life.</div>

<p>The Internet has transformed from a specialized communication network for scientists into a global system connecting billions of people. Its origins date back to the late 1960s, when the U.S. Department of Defense developed ARPANET to enable secure information sharing among researchers. Initially, the network connected only a few universities and government institutions. Over time, technological advancements led to broader accessibility and the birth of a revolutionary communication medium. What started as a small network for exchanging data soon became a foundation for global interaction, setting the stage for unprecedented connectivity.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, the development of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) standardized data exchange, allowing different networks to communicate. This innovation laid the foundation for the modern Internet. In the early 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web, a system of interlinked documents accessed through browsers. This made the Internet far more user-friendly, leading to rapid global expansion. Personal computers became more affordable, and educational institutions began integrating the Internet into research and learning, further accelerating its spread.</p>
<p>By the early 21st century, the Internet had become essential for business, education, entertainment, and social interaction. The rise of broadband and mobile technologies allowed people to access information anywhere and anytime. Social media platforms emerged, connecting individuals across continents and enabling the instant exchange of ideas, images, and news. Online shopping, video streaming, and digital communication transformed how societies function, making the Internet an indispensable part of daily routines.</p>
<p>Despite these benefits, the Internet also brought challenges. Issues such as cybersecurity threats, misinformation, and privacy concerns have become pressing. Governments and organizations continually work to create regulations and technologies that protect users while preserving the openness of the Internet. Today, emerging trends like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things continue to reshape the digital landscape. As these technologies develop, they influence economies, education systems, and even political processes.</p>
<p>The evolution of the Internet reflects both technological progress and societal change.

(2)</p></div>
            <div class="answer">The two major challenges that have emerged due to the internet&#39;s growth are cybersecurity threats and misinformation.
Issues in cybersecurity lead to privacy concerns and data safety, and it remains a huge threat to governments and organizations. These include data fraud and hacking their database and getting confidential information that is not meant to be leaked and resulting in huge loss. 
Another main issue is misinformation, which leads to false data and rumors that spread across social media and lead to public panic.</div>
