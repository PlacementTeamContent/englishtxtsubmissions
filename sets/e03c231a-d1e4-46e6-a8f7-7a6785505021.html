            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Write a well-organized paragraph of about 200 words on the topic “If I Were a Character in My Favourite Series/Movie.”</p></div>
            <div class="answer">my favourite character is from an amine called &#34;One Piece&#34; his name is luffy...his story is about becoming the king of pirates. His character is joyful and funny. when it comes to his crew. he is the best captain...some of rules which i personally follow is ( don&#39;t waste food, smile whatever happens, be helpful to everyone who are in need) his character inspires me a lot, like  he will be funny , joking around here and there , being playful to everyone, but the most kind heart person. I generally want to become real life &#34;luffy&#34;, so i can keep everyone happy around me. i wanna be leader but not the strict one, the person who should be loved by everyone, my dream was to go into the animated whole and meet luffy.. go advancers with him, have fun with crew mates, i even have my own team in my college who are really good people, and to them i want to become the luffy. even my name  means the person who bring joy to everyone. so i want to become luffyy...if i get a chance to become a character.</div>

            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Read the passage carefully. Then, answer all the questions that follow. Write your answers in full sentences and use information from the passage to support your answers.<br><br>Passage: The Future of Renewable Energy The increasing demand for energy and the growing concerns over climate change have pushed nations to explore renewable energy sources more seriously than ever before. Renewable energy refers to power generated from resources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, these sources are sustainable and produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions, making them essential for a cleaner and more stable future. Solar energy has seen the fastest growth over the past decade. Improvements in photovoltaic (PV) technology have significantly lowered costs, allowing households and industries to install solar panels on rooftops or in large solar farms. Similarly, wind power has expanded rapidly, with both onshore and offshore wind farms supplying electricity to millions. Countries like Denmark and Germany have invested heavily in wind energy, often generating more power from wind than their total national demand on particularly windy days. Another emerging area is energy storage. Since solar and wind energy are intermittent, effective storage systems are crucial for ensuring a stable supply. Advances in battery technologies, such as lithium-ion and solid-state batteries, are making it possible to store surplus energy and use it during periods of low generation. Additionally, innovative grid management systems are helping integrate these renewable sources more efficiently into national power networks. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The initial investment for large-scale renewable infrastructure is high, which can be a barrier for developing countries. Furthermore, renewable energy projects often face regulatory hurdles and public opposition due to land use concerns. Addressing these issues requires coordinated policy frameworks, technological innovation, and public engagement to ensure a smooth transition to sustainable energy systems. The future of renewable energy is promising. With continued investment, supportive policies, and technological breakthroughs, renewable energy has the potential to become the dominant source of global power, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating the impacts of climate change.<br><br>Name two main sources of renewable energy mentioned in the passage.
