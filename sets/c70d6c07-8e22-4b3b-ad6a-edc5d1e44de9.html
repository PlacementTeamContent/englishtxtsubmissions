<p>In the 21st century, the world has witnessed an unprecedented surge in digital connectivity. The internet, social media, and smartphones have revolutionized how humans communicate, learn, and form relationships. While this digital expansion has shrunk geographical distances and made information universally accessible, it has also introduced a paradoxical sense of isolation. Individuals are more “connected” than ever, yet many report heightened feelings of loneliness and disconnection.One of the main causes of this paradox lies in the quality of interactions. Online exchanges often lack the depth and empathy present in face-to-face communication. Digital conversations, limited by emojis and abbreviations, can fail to capture emotional nuances. As a result, people might have numerous virtual “friends” but few meaningful relationships. Moreover, the constant exposure to curated online lives can lead to social comparison, fostering insecurity and dissatisfaction.Another dimension of this paradox is the illusion of productivity. Technology promises efficiency, but constant notifications and multitasking often fragment attention. Studies show that individuals who frequently switch between digital tasks experience reduced concentration and memory retention. The “always-on” culture, driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO), has blurred boundaries between personal and professional life, contributing to mental exhaustion and stress.Yet, digital connectivity is not inherently detrimental. It has democratized education, enabled remote work, and amplified global awareness on issues like climate change and social justice. The key challenge lies in achieving balance—using technology mindfully without allowing it to dominate human experience. Digital literacy programs and conscious online habits can foster a healthier relationship with technology.Ultimately, digital connectivity represents both progress and peril. It mirrors human intention: the same tools that unite can also divide, depending on how they are used. The paradox, then, is not in technology itself but in humanity’s dependence on it.<br><br> Questions: How can individuals apply digital literacy to reduce the negative effects of technology?

            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Write a well-organized paragraph of about 200 words on the topic “If I Met a Genie, What Would Be My Three Wishes.”<br><br>Topic: If I Met a Genie, What Would Be My Three Wishes • Describe the situation and how you meet the genie. • Clearly explain each of your three wishes and why they are important to you. • Present your ideas in a logical and engaging sequence. • Make your description lively and imaginative. • End with a thoughtful reflection on your choices.</p></div>
            <div class="answer">I went to my attic to clean and then suddenly there was a golden lamp near my book shelf. I looked thoroughly and rubbed  it three times and suddenly a genie appeared and asked me to ask three wishes. I thought for a moment about what I can ask and after some time I was ready to ask those wishes. First thing I asked  was to eradicate world hunger because most of our people die due to hunger and starvation. The second wish I asked for is to provide shelter to the homeless people as even though many of us are using ac during summer they don&#39;t even have a shelter to live and die due to the extreme climatic conditions. I asked my final wish which was peace as many of us know each and every country are killing each other in the name of war which is nothing but to gain popularity and dominance over other countries and most of the citizens are only dying as they are the only one&#39;s who will get affected. Genie granted all my wishes and told me that I was a vey kind person who is selfless and only sole one to use all these wishes wisely .</div>
