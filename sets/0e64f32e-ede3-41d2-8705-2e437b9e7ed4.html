            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Write a well-organized paragraph of about 200 words on the topic “The Role of Sports in Education.” Use facts, examples, and logical explanations to support your ideas.</p></div>
            <div class="answer">The Role of Sports in Education
We know that education is all about the growth of a student in his/her life. It&#39;s not just about memorizing facts and writing them down or remembering the theorems that&#39;s already been proven. It&#39;s about the overall development of the student in all aspects such as discipline, social skills, problem-solving, sports and many more.
Most parents think that just good marks and high percentages can create a good life for their child. But in reality, that&#39;s not the case. Their child will be able to create a great life for themselves and help others create one only by focusing on holistic development. One of the important aspect is sports. Sports is a very important skill that enhances one&#39;s capabilities and mental strength. The student will be able to think properly and it directly helps him/her in studies. It boosts hormones and creates a sense of responsibilty. While playing a team sports, the student would build up loyalty and responsibilty for the team and his teammates. This helps a child to excel both in sports and his academics which results in a great future.</div>

            <div class="question"><p><b>Instruction:</b> Read the passage carefully. Then, answer all the questions that follow. Write your answers in full sentences and use information from the passage to support your answers.<br><br>Passage: The Future of Renewable Energy The increasing demand for energy and the growing concerns over climate change have pushed nations to explore renewable energy sources more seriously than ever before. Renewable energy refers to power generated from resources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, these sources are sustainable and produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions, making them essential for a cleaner and more stable future. Solar energy has seen the fastest growth over the past decade. Improvements in photovoltaic (PV) technology have significantly lowered costs, allowing households and industries to install solar panels on rooftops or in large solar farms. Similarly, wind power has expanded rapidly, with both onshore and offshore wind farms supplying electricity to millions. Countries like Denmark and Germany have invested heavily in wind energy, often generating more power from wind than their total national demand on particularly windy days. Another emerging area is energy storage. Since solar and wind energy are intermittent, effective storage systems are crucial for ensuring a stable supply. Advances in battery technologies, such as lithium-ion and solid-state batteries, are making it possible to store surplus energy and use it during periods of low generation. Additionally, innovative grid management systems are helping integrate these renewable sources more efficiently into national power networks. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The initial investment for large-scale renewable infrastructure is high, which can be a barrier for developing countries. Furthermore, renewable energy projects often face regulatory hurdles and public opposition due to land use concerns. Addressing these issues requires coordinated policy frameworks, technological innovation, and public engagement to ensure a smooth transition to sustainable energy systems. The future of renewable energy is promising. With continued investment, supportive policies, and technological breakthroughs, renewable energy has the potential to become the dominant source of global power, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating the impacts of climate change.<br><br>Name two main sources of renewable energy mentioned in the passage.

            <div class="answer">He was always quiet in the class. He never really made any friends. He felt peaceful drifting in his own reality. Nobody really cared much. He didn&#39;t wanted to be bothered either. Students said he was full of attitude, but actually he was shy. He was scared to talk. He was afraid people would judge him. He had no choice. But this all came to an end. After completing school, began the next phase of life, &#34;The College&#34;. It was new for him. He felt alone and left behind while the world was moving fast. He entered the gate on the first day as the &#34;shy student&#34;. Its not new for him to be shy and introverted, but the surroundings didn&#39;t really let him be the same. his first introduction went quite well. He was assigned a group for an assignment. The team members were really helpful and started helping out. They realized his nature and provided him the comfort he needed and motivated him to become socially active. They had lunch together. As the life goes, there were misunderstandings. But through his honest talk, he created an even more stronger bond than before. He slowly started speaking out.</div>
