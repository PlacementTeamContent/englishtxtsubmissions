The 20th century marked the beginning of humanity’s journey beyond Earth. Space exploration began during the Cold War, driven by competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, which orbited Earth and marked the dawn of the Space Age. This event inspired the United States to intensify its space program, leading to rapid advancements in technology and exploration.A major milestone occurred in 1961 when Yuri Gagarin became the first human to travel into space aboard Vostok 1. This achievement demonstrated that humans could survive and operate beyond Earth’s atmosphere. The competition reached its peak in 1969 when NASA’s Apollo 11 mission successfully landed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon. Armstrong’s famous words, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,” symbolized human ambition and scientific progress.After the Moon landings, space exploration evolved from rivalry to international cooperation. The establishment of the International Space Station (ISS) in the late 1990s brought together space agencies from the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan, and Canada. The ISS serves as a research laboratory where astronauts conduct experiments in biology, physics, and medicine in microgravity, leading to discoveries that benefit life on Earth.Today, space exploration is entering a new phase. Private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are playing key roles by developing reusable rockets and planning commercial missions. Countries such as China and India are expanding their space programs, aiming for lunar bases and Mars exploration. Future missions may focus on asteroid mining, deep-space travel, and the search for extraterrestrial life.Space exploration reflects humanity’s enduring curiosity and technological innovation. What began as a geopolitical competition has transformed into a shared global endeavor to understand the universe and our place in it.<br><br> Questions: How has space exploration changed since the Cold War?

<p>In the 21st century, the world has witnessed an unprecedented surge in digital connectivity. The internet, social media, and smartphones have revolutionized how humans communicate, learn, and form relationships. While this digital expansion has shrunk geographical distances and made information universally accessible, it has also introduced a paradoxical sense of isolation. Individuals are more “connected” than ever, yet many report heightened feelings of loneliness and disconnection.One of the main causes of this paradox lies in the quality of interactions. Online exchanges often lack the depth and empathy present in face-to-face communication. Digital conversations, limited by emojis and abbreviations, can fail to capture emotional nuances. As a result, people might have numerous virtual “friends” but few meaningful relationships. Moreover, the constant exposure to curated online lives can lead to social comparison, fostering insecurity and dissatisfaction.Another dimension of this paradox is the illusion of productivity. Technology promises efficiency, but constant notifications and multitasking often fragment attention. Studies show that individuals who frequently switch between digital tasks experience reduced concentration and memory retention. The “always-on” culture, driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO), has blurred boundaries between personal and professional life, contributing to mental exhaustion and stress.Yet, digital connectivity is not inherently detrimental. It has democratized education, enabled remote work, and amplified global awareness on issues like climate change and social justice. The key challenge lies in achieving balance—using technology mindfully without allowing it to dominate human experience. Digital literacy programs and conscious online habits can foster a healthier relationship with technology.Ultimately, digital connectivity represents both progress and peril. It mirrors human intention: the same tools that unite can also divide, depending on how they are used. The paradox, then, is not in technology itself but in humanity’s dependence on it.<br><br>Questions: Explain how the “illusion of productivity” contributes to the paradox of digital connectivity.
